2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell FSM0/Q_reg[20]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) T0/Q_reg_reg[15]/CLR, T0/Q_reg_reg[16]/CLR, T0/Q_reg_reg[17]/CLR,
T0/Q_reg_reg[18]/CLR, T0/Q_reg_reg[19]/CLR, T0/Q_reg_reg[1]/CLR,
T0/Q_reg_reg[20]/CLR, T0/Q_reg_reg[2]/CLR, T0/Q_reg_reg[3]/CLR,
T0/Q_reg_reg[4]/CLR, T0/Q_reg_reg[5]/CLR, T0/Q_reg_reg[6]/CLR,
T0/Q_reg_reg[7]/CLR, T0/Q_reg_reg[8]/CLR, T0/Q_reg_reg[9]/CLR
 (the first 15 of 21 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
